# 👋 Hi, I'm Aditya Raj Sharma!

I am a **Software Engineer** passionate about creating meaningful, human-centered digital experiences. I hold a Master's degree 🎓 in **Computer Science & Engineering** from **UC San Diego**, with a specialization in **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**.

## 🛠️ What I Do:
- **Full Stack Development**: Building fault-tolerant, scalable applications backed by HCI research.
- **Product Development**: End-to-end product lifecycle from Problem Specification to Product Deployment. So if you have a start-up idea, hit me up!
- **AI & Automation**: Fiddling with GenAI to *exploit* it for enhanced Usability

## 🌱 Currently Learning:
- **Generative AI for End-User Programming**: Integrating AI with HCI to make programming accessible to a non-programmer.
- **Astro JS** for blazingly fast Front-ends!

## ✨ Fun Fact:
I write and sing Indian folk songs that belong to the Bhaktikaal era of music!
